# Low Light Image Enhancement for Advanced Driver Assistance System

The repository contains the jupyter notebook implementation of low light enhancement of images, along with the code for synthetic generation of realistic-like night images from original day images.

## Abstract 

* Low light image enhancement has always been a challenging task since last few decades especially for the connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) as it increases the risk of crash in low vision conditions. Although, quite a few amount of work is being done in past to develop an effective and efficient algorithm but still there is a scope of improvement. In this project, Histogram Equalization(HE) algorithms (e.g. Contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE)), Retinex-based algorithms(e.g. Multi-Scale Retinex (MSR)) and Learning based algorithms(e.g. U-Net, Pix2Pix and Fast-IP Net) are implemented with different parameters settings and their comparison is made quantitatively and qualitatively. Results showed that Pix2Pix and U-Net model outperforms the other methods and generate better results.
